# Worked on Leetcode problem https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/

## Find if robot walking will go into endless loop given commands, L, R G

51/110 Test cases correct. I first tested if we got to 360 degrees. But that failed because it didn't account for 360 degree loops that occur after executing the commands for more additional time. I didn't get this problem correct, and probably would've required an hour so to successfully complete. We attempted it for 30 minutes.
