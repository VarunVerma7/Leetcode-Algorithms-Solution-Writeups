# Worked on Leetcode problem

## Find Unique BSTs of size N

Conceptually got the problem right. Divide N into its subarrays
of the left and right side. However, failed to put it into a working algorithm so understanding was not strong enough. Need better understanding of dynamic programming concepts.
